This is a sample web application built using play framework 2.2.x

The web application runs as https://www.airlines.com:9443/
Modify /etc/hosts file as

127.0.0.1		www.airlines.com

The following languages and tenchologies were used:-

1. HTML
2. Scala - for rendering HTML pages
3. Java - for back-end logic
5. Bootstrap 3 - for the CSS, jQuery and JS support and the look
6. mySQL - for database
7. Eclipse Luna - for application development

The following has been implemented inside of this application:-

1. Caching - If a search is present in the cache, it is fetched from the Cache API, else the database is queried
2. Communication over HTTPS - following were the commands used to generate the server certificate

keytool -genkey -alias keyAlias -keyalg RSA -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -keystore keystore.jks
keytool -export -alias keyAlias -storepass changeit -file server.cer -keystore keystore.jks
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias keyAlias -file server.cer -keystore cacerts.jks -keypass changeit -storepass changeit

After the certificates are generated, restart the application binding to an HTTPS port as

-Dhttp.port=disabled -Dhttps.port=9443 -Dhttps.keyStore="D:\Github\Web-programming-languages\AirlineReservation\conf\server.cer" -Dhttps.keyStorePassword=changeit

3. Request/Response compression - gzip used
4. Authentication/Authorization - The functionalities for booking and user summary require user authorization for access
5. Asynchronous service - All the web services are routed to AJAX actions
6. Single Sign-On - Twitter API used to authenticate over HTTP (not HTTPS)

If running in HTTPS, manually enter the home page url after authentication from Twitter as redirection will not be possible

7. ORM - Ebean model used

The following has been implemented outside of this application:-

1. Application redundancy
2. Database sharding

To configure this application :-

1. Run the database queries on mySQL server in the order :-
CreateDB.sql
CreateTables.sql
LoadData.sql

2. Install the play framework 2.2
3. Go the this project`s root directory and enter the command

D:\Github\Web-programming-languages\AirlineReservation>"C:\Users\Ekal\Downloads\UTD\play-2.2.6\play"

In the play CLI, enter the commmands in the order:-
update
clean
eclipse
compile
exit

On the CMD prompt, enter the command

D:\Github\Web-programming-languages\AirlineReservation>"C:\Users\Ekal\Downloads\UTD\play-2.2.6\play" -Dhttp.port=disabled -Dhttps.port=9443 -Dhttps.keyStore="D:\Github\Web-programming-languages\AirlineReservation\conf\keystore.jks" -Dhttps.keyStorePassword=changeit run
